Consumer Behavior Analysis Project Project Overview This project focuses on analyzing consumer behavior in both online and offline shopping environments using Olist consumer data. 
It is divided into two main parts: Olist Consumer Data Analysis and Exploring Consumer Behavior in Online and Offline Shopping Environments**.

# Part 1: Olist Consumer Data Analysis
In this section, we delve into the rich dataset provided by Olist, a Brazilian e-commerce platform. The analysis includes:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning to ensure data quality.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and insights.
- Visualization techniques to present findings effectively.
- Statistical analysis to derive meaningful conclusions about consumer behavior.

# Part 2: Exploring Consumer Behavior in Online and Offline Shopping Environments
This part of the project focuses on comparing consumer behavior between online and offline shopping contexts. Key aspects include:
- Identifying differences in purchasing patterns, preferences, and decision-making processes.
- Analyzing factors influencing consumer choices in each environment.
- Understanding how demographics and other variables impact shopping behavior.
- Importance of Studying Consumer Behavior

# Understanding consumer behavior is crucial for several reasons:
- Market Understanding: Helps businesses anticipate market trends and adapt strategies accordingly.
- Customer Satisfaction: Enables customization of products and services to meet consumer preferences.
- Competitive Advantage: Provides insights for gaining a competitive edge in the market.
- Marketing Effectiveness: Improves targeting and messaging effectiveness in marketing campaigns.

# Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for Olist Study
To measure the effectiveness and impact of the Olist study on consumer behavior, the following KPIs will be monitored:
- Purchse frequency
- Customer Lifetime Value
